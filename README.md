## Description

A simple, **presentational** website designed for a band or music store. This project served as an initial practice in my front-end development journey. As my first personal project, it focuses on the use of HTML and CSS.

- Initially, there was no **JavaScript** involved, but it later facilitated the implementation of a burger icon functionality, lazy-loading images, and section reveals. This marked the beginning of my JavaScript learning experience.

## Overview

The project showcases a landing webpage with a strong emphasis on semantic HTML and mobile-first design principles. Key aspects include:

- **Semantic HTML**: Writing clean and meaningful HTML code.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizing media queries to ensure the website is mobile-friendly.
- **CSS Practice**: Understanding the box model and, Flexbox for layout management.
- **JavaScript Integration**: Introducing JavaScript to implement features such as a burger menu, sticky navbar, section reveals on scroll, and lazy loading images.
- **Form Structure**: Demonstrating the semantic structure of an HTML form, though the form itself does not submit data.

This project served as a foundational exercise in front-end development, combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and visually appealing web application.
